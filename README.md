# Pulse Interval Stats
  
This Digital Measurer allows for calculating stats about pulse intervals.

The first state transition seen determines the pulse polarity: if a RISING
transition is seen first, HIGH intervals will be measured; if a FALLING
transition is seen first, LOW intervals will be measured.
